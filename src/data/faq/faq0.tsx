    question:
      "2. What are the different Badge tiers within SOULBOUND, and how do they function?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          The SOULBOUND Protocol operates as a launchpad 2.0. Users need a
          SoulBound <strong>BADGE</strong> to participate, which allows them to
          invest in projects or build their own networks.{" "}
          <strong>BADGEs have referral</strong> code, and users can add new
          members to their branching maps using their referral code.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Within the SOULBOUND Protocol, there are three badge tiers: Common,
          Epic, and Legendary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Common Badge:</strong> Offers basic platform access and
          participation in the referral program for branching rewards.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Epic Badge:</strong> Provides increased project allocations,
          better staking rewards, and improved platform privileges.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Legendary Badge:</strong> Represents the highest tier,
          granting the most significant project allocations, highest staking
          rewards, and exclusive platform privileges.

    question: "3. How can I participate Soulbound Launchpad IDO?",
    answer: (

        Soulbound Badge holders (three tiers) get three different tiers of
        allocations from these projects before they release to the market.
        <br />
        Users who stake Soulbound Governance token $SBB will get additional
        allocation of the projects besides the badge allocation.

        <p>Initial Distribution</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A total of 21,000 badges will be initially issued, distributed across
          three distinct tiers: Legendary, Epic, and Common. The allocation of
          badges is designed to create a balanced and exclusive ecosystem that
          rewards both early adopters and active participants. Each offering
          distinct benefits such as increased project allocations, enhanced
          staking rewards, and exclusive access to platform features.

    question:
      "5. Which chain is the Badge deployed on? And is it transferable and tradable?",
    answer: (
      <>
        SoulBound Badges are deployed on all EVM chains. Badges are special
        non-transferable NFTs of the SOULBOUND platform before 21,000 badges are
        sold out. They represent the userâ€™s identity on the platform and are
        related to the opportunity of participating in subsequent IDO projects.
        Having a Badge means that the user has a whitelist.

      "6. How does the airdrop campaign work? Is the airdrop Badge or $SBB token? If it is Badge, what tier of the badge is the airdrop?",
    answer: (
      <>
        The current AirDrop campaign is to airdrop badges, limited to 1,000
        pieces, divided into three levels of value, Common (100U), Epic (500U),
        Legendary (1,000U) randomly selected. In the future, the early badge
        holders will be airdropped with $SBB.

    question:
      "7. How does normal user (non airdrop winner) get badge and have access to the launchpad IDO?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          In the early stage, we launched a Badge airdrop for the community, and
          other users can only obtain Badges through invitation. Users need a
          referral code to purchase the badge on the website:
          <a href="https://www.soulboundbtc.com/buy-badge">
            https://www.soulboundbtc.com/buy-badge
          </a>{" "}
          There is only one referral code per person, while the code can be used
          unlimited times. New users can choose which badge tier to buy after
          getting the referral code, and the rewards of the inviter are
          determined by the amount purchased by the invitee (10-14% rewards in
          BTC and BNB)

    question:
      "8.  How do I exit the badge if I want to sell and no longer participate in the launchpad IDO?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Users can exit badges by converting to SBB, and the converting page
          will be providing flexibility for users who may want to transition
          their assets within the ecosystem. When the user converts to $SBB, the
          system will verify that the address has been referred to, and if
          someone else has been invited and is rewarded, the number of $SBB
          conversions will be reduced by the referring he has received.
